// The contract below represents a very simple game: whoever sends it an amount of ether that is larger than the current prize becomes the new king. On such an event, the overthrown king gets paid the new prize, making a bit of ether in the process! As ponzi as it gets xD

// Such a fun game. Your goal is to break it.

// When you submit the instance back to the level, the level is going to reclaim kingship. You will beat the level if you can avoid such a self proclamation.

// After:

// Most of Ethernaut's levels try to expose (in an oversimplified form of course) something that actually happened â€” a real hack or a real bug.

// In this case, see: King of the Ether and King of the Ether Postmortem.
